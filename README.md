# Malware

Just a quick and easy ransomware  
uses Fernet to generate a key and encrypt every file in the directory with the key  
the only way to decrypt the content is if you saved the key in a file "key.key" , and that's exactly what i did because i'm not trying to make anyone lose their files lol
